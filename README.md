# pylog
A library that will log your inputs and outputs of your functions, eventually creating docstrings for your functions and helping you debug

To start using this libary, go to your command line and type: 

`git clone https://github.com/kennethgoodman/pylog.git`

Then go into the directory `cd pylog`

So download python3.6 (if you havn't already done so): go to https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/ and download your correct version 

To run the example: `python3.6 fileToTestWith.py` I am using 3.6 to devlop, this library currently supports versions >= 3.5. Backwards compatibility will come soon.

notice the new files, there should be two new files, one txt file, and one new python file. Look at the new python file ( fileToTestOn__.py ) side by side with fileToTestOn.py to see what the code actually did.
